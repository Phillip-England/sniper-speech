AI CODEBASE RULES & OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS
================================================================

RULE #1: SIMULTANEOUS KEY EVENT CYCLES (KEY UP REQUIREMENT)
----------------------------------------------------------------
CONTEXT:
Running commands on the server that utilize the "Key Down" event, 
specifically when pressing two keys simultaneously (Modifier + Key).

EXAMPLES:
- Control + P (Print)
- Control + X (Cut)
- Control + V (Paste)

REQUIREMENT:
Every time a "Key Down" command is executed for a key combination, 
it must be immediately followed by a corresponding "Key Up" command 
for those specific keys.

REASONING:
This step is mandatory to ensure the server recognizes that the 
keys have been released. Failing to do so leaves the keys in a 
"pressed" state, which will interfere with and corrupt the input 
of any future commands.
